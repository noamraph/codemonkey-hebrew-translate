# CodeMonkey Hebrew Translate

## Right-click a word in the code, and hear the Hebrew translation

Install the chrome extension from here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codemonkey-hebrew-transla/bnnfadbdjepplpanidmheecjgmehbkpn

It can be hard for kids to learn to code in English, when they don't know English. This extension helps, by letting the child hear the Hebrew translation of a word (and also its English pronunciation) in CodeMonkey when he right-clicks the word.

Note: this extension sends words that were right-clicked and don't yet have a translation to a Google Form, in order for me to record their translation.
